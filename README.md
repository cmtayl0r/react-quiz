# The React Quiz

A Simple Quiz app that provides a series of multi choice questions with a point scoring and timer mechanism.

## What I learnt

- useReducer Hook and how to manage a more complex state beyond useState
- Different approach to dealing with "status" (loading, error, finish etc) because of the Reducer function
- USing useEffect hook to create a countdown timer based on the amount of questions in the quiz

## Todo list

[ ] Collect all answers in an array so a user can review their answers or navigate back to them
[ ] Send the high score to the fake data API (JSON server) so a user can retrieve the high score every time they init the app
